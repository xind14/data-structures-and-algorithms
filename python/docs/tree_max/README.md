Write the following method for the Binary Tree class

- find maximum value

  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: number

## Approach & Efficiency

  1. Write out problem statement
  2. drew it out first because I didn't get it
  3. looked at binary tree code for help
  4. create find max function
  5. use in order to return list values and loop through them for comparison 

  6. The Big O time is O(n) where n is number of nodes in tree and iterates over all nodes once. Space: O(n) because it stores all nodes using in order traversal
