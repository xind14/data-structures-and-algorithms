- Arguments: 2 linked lists

## Approach & Efficiency

  1. Write out problem statement
  2. drew it out first because I didn't get it
  3. create length count
  4. loop through it to move the current to k
  5. return value
  6. The Big O time is O(N) because only iterating each value once and space is O(1) because it gives back a single value
