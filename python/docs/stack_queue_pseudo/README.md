# Stack Queue Pseudo

1. Create a new class called pseudo queue.
    - Do not use an existing Queue.
    - Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
    - Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
2. Methods:
    - enqueue
        - Arguments: value
        - Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
    - dequeue
        - Arguments: none
        - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
3. NOTE: The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Write out problem statement
2. Looked at past challenge that used middle split
3. wrote test cases with given and output
4. wrote algorithm that follows basic test case
5. drew image that follows that algorithm
6. wrote solution on replit
7. The Big O time is O(log n) and space is O(1)
