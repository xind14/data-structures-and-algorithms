None. Not a whiteboard

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Node
    - Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
2. Linked List
    - Create a Linked List class
    - Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
    - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
3. The class should contain the following methods
    - insert
        - Arguments: value
        - Returns: nothing
        - Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
    - includes
        - Arguments: value
        - Returns: Boolean
            - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    - to string
        - Arguments: none
        - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
        "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
