CHALLENGE 1

In the addPeople function, use spread and destructuring assignments to:
  - Create a new array called newPeople as a copy of the people array
  - Add a person named 'Odie' added to the beginning of the array
  - Add another one named 'Garfield' added to the end of the array

Prove that the original people array is unchanged

Using spread and destructuring assignment, create a new object called newStuff, which is a copy of the stuff object, with a new car added to the end of the cars array within it

Create a state object with keys of people and stuff that contain the people and stuff data.
Do this using object destructuring assignment

Using spread and destructuring assignments, create a new object called newSate, repeating the newPeople and newStuff steps above but directly within the people and stuff nodes of the state object (don't just spread in newPeople and newStuff)

Ensure that the original people, stuff, and state are unchanged.

const addPeople = (arr) => {
  // Solution code here...
  const newPeople = [ 'Odie', ...people, 'Garfield']
  return newPeople;
};




/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGE 2

In the setSate function, use spread and destructuring assignments to:
  - Create and return a state object with 2 keys:
    people, which will contain a copy of the people array
    stuff, which will contain a copy of the stuff object

Ensure that the original people array and stuff objects are unchanged

Using spread and destructuring assignments, create a new object called newSate, repeating the newPeople and newStuff steps above but directly within the people and stuff nodes of the state object (don't just spread in newPeople and newStuff)
Prove that the original people, stuff, and state are unchanged.

const setState = (arr) => {
  // Solution code here...

};

CHALLENGE 3

In the newState function, use only spread and destructuring assignments to:
  - Create and return a state object with 2 keys:
    people, which will contain a copy of the people array
    stuff, which will contain a copy of the stuff object
    Add a new car ("Ford") added to the list of cars
    Change the toothbrush from "frayed" to "brand new"
    Add 1 to the number of toys

Ensure that the original people array and stuff objects are unchanged

const newState = (arr) => {
  // Solution code here...
